### Utilize the SimCLR method to train the model in  Sleep Stage Classification task
#### In the paper, SimCLR use large-scale learning rate with LARS(optimization).
#### However, in the experiments, I found that SimCLR needs small-scale learning rate with 'Adam' optimization to train the model in Sleep Stage Classification task.
